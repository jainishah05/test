variable declaration:- var keyword used.
for print something:- document.write() used.
var.length:- it specifies the length of a string var.
Strings:- To print doubleQuotes("") inside a string,which is enclosed within(""),slash(\) is used..same for single quotes('').
	  To print slash(\) inside a string,doubleSlash(\\) is used.
indexOf():-returns the index of the first occurance of a specified text in a string.
	   syntax:-indexOf("string") or indexOf("string",starting_point_no).
lastIndexOf():-returns the index of the last occurance of a specified text in a string.
	      syntax:-lastIndexOf("string") or lastIndexOf("string",starting_point_no).
Above both functions returns -1,if string is not found.

search():-Searching a text from a given string and returns index of it.
	  syntax:-search("string")
Diff between indexOf() & search():-
	The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
	The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).
slice():-extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
	 syntax:- slice(start,end),if 2nd parameter is not defined then it will take the rest of the string.
substr():-same as slice.but parameters are different.
	 syntax:- slice(start,size),if 2nd parameter is not defined then it will take the rest of the string.
replace:- replacing string contents.To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global match).i.e, str.replace(/Microsoft/g, "google");
charAt():- returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.
charCodeAt():- returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string,it returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535).

Numbers:-

NaN(Not a Number):-when a numeric value is divided by non-numeric string it becomes NaN or output will be given as "NaN".
Infinity:-when a numeric value is divided by 0 it becomes Infinity(/-Infinity,depend on number) or output will be given as "Infinity/-Infinity".
toString():- To convert a number into decimal,hexadec,octal or binary,this method is used.i.e,toString(16)-returns hexadec value.

Hoisting:- javascript's default of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope.in js,we can use variable without declaring it or we can use variable before declaring it.variables defined with const or let keyword can not be hoisted.

"use strict":- Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".when we use "use strict" in our js-code,it can not performed hoisting.

Array,syntax:-
Javascript array is an object.
var arrayname = new Array(array elements)
or
var arrayname = new Array(size)
a[0]="" is used to define array elements.
or
var arrayname = [array elements]

objects are powerful datatype of js.here,object is a collection of values.collection is something that makes sense.i.e,a house or a person,which contains multiple properties.
To create an Object,syntax:-

	var objName
	{
	 property/name:value;
	}
To access object properties,syntax:-

	objName.propertyName;
	or
	objName["propertyName"];

Function syntax:-
1.defining function:-
	in head section,
	function funname(arguments){fun body;}
2.calling function:-
	in body section,
	function funname(arguments)
Alert:-
	used to alert user,it's like a pop-up box. 
innerHTML:- To write into HTML element.
window.alert():-To write into an alert box.
console.log():-To write into the browser console.
Operators:-
bitwise operator:- for the output of bitwise operator javascript uses 32-bit signed structure.

Events:- Event is something that cause something or that user/browser does.
	-onclick:-on clicking button.
	-onchange:-on changing an HTML element.
	-onmouseover:- when user moves cursor on any HTML element.
	-onmousedown:- when user releases cursor focus on HTML element.
	-onload:- when loading of page has been finished.
	-onkeydown:- when user presses any key of keyboard. 

EventHandler:- It handles events that needs to be caused.it handles and verifies all the browser and user actions.i.e,what will be displayes on page after clicking a button,what will be displayed everytime after loading a particualr web page,etc.
